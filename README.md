# Adventure game Mark 1

- This was first made for learning python. It has a basic flow with basic principles.

- You enter your name, choose a class and get a brief story intro.

- From there you enter a swamp that has descriptions in a grid which the player navigates.

- There are random enemy encounters, but in this early draft they are very weak to allow for testing.

- Navigate to the "Castle" in order to win

- Mark 1 is completed, lessons learned will be implemented in Mark 2 which will begin soon.
